Players use ".event join pvp" command (you can do it #csWhatev)
Once they join basic query: replace into character_pvpevent guid, oponent, status, rank


status 0 - waiting to fight
status 1 - being teleported
status 2 - fighting opponent

rank 0 - all start
rank 1 - one win
rank 2 - two wins
etc
if they lose we don't care, just remove immediately


When to trigger the event:
1. gm command (I can make it, just make start function)
2. world events (at time X, we need another event type)

How the event runs:
0. Check if 2 or more players guid are online if not remove offline players from sql
1. Pair characters 2 by 2 and teleport them somewhere (unk atm) If they are 5 for example ether remove last one or keep it as backup (kind of complicated last part)
2. Make a NPC script that keeps both of them in a radius and everyone else out of the radius
3. Count time since they been teleported, if more then 5 min passed kill both and remove from sql
4. If disconnect/logout/exit remove player from sql and also declare other winner
5. If all fights are over check if more then 2 remain, if they both finished fights then tp both or again 2 by 2 to unk map for round 2
6. 1 remains in the end, no matter what, naturally, he's the winner, that's it!
