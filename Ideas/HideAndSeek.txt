give clues about locations using lore. Players need to find it

Set a limit to how many spawns
Spawn penguins modelid1: 25390 sau 24698 on all maps, no clues
penguin_script - all it has to do on click is to say 
1. "You found me!", I'll take care of the rest, rewards etc
2. Remove penguin_script spawn 
That's it

Probably the hardest part is the random spawn.
