You select or switch between game modes on Taxi in first 2 hours of playtime, no later. (this will be checked by taxi)
Menu Option to select game mode can look like Normal Mode / IronMan Mode / Hardcode Mode
Once 2 hours pass you remain with last/current selected mode without possibility to change anymore.

What is IronMan:
- basically can not buy anything from other players
- can't use AH, Mail, Trade
- can't join a guild or sign any petition
+ custom title in game IronMan

What is Hardcode:
Ironman conditions + full solo mode, no group no nothing
- can not group
- can not bg
+ custom title in game Hardcore

What's the point of having this 2 extra game modes?

1. Separate Highscore
2. Something New
3. Makes game more challanging
4. We can make them feel special (exculive NPC shop and after 2 hours 1 free profession,
 some special mount, 0.1% more dmg in pvp or whatever is easy to code)
5. Bonus Honor / Arena points for each win
6. More credits / rewards for whatever.... vote, promote server, etc
7. Would be even better if we could add like a Chat badge for them if possible or different color name in chat.
