	- timed instances
	- new item tiers based on amount of stats rewarded ? try to change purple color to some new color
	- talent point mod item will add talents every time you spend them
	- create personalized drop list ? This way the roll chance mods would be more visible
	- paladins at lvl 32 will eat up extra 3 talents. On levelup talent will reset. If you force reset talents, it will be all good
	- chat connector should show realm name
	- impelent mass loot
	- check for addon compatibility issues

	- somehow implement instance leveling : as soon as you clear an instance at a specific difficulty, it will enable a higher level
	- spell hit rating is a lot worse than melee hit rating. Compensate somehow ?
	- player stat drop table could be static as long as drop chances stay the same. This is to avoid very large tables ( 6k values )
	- insert into `character_item_randomizations` (`PlayerGUID`, `ItemGUID`, `t1`, `p1`, `t2`, `p2`, `t3`, `p3`, `t4`, `p4`, `t5`, `p5`, `t6`, `p6`, `t7`, `p7`, `t8`, `p8`, `t9`, `p9`, `t10`, `p10`, `t11`, `p11`, `t12`, `p12`, `t13`, `p13`, `t14`, `p14`, `t15`, `p15`) values('1127','333199','128','3','159','100','20','69.27','257','100','154','100','208','100','223','6.15','111','32.7','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0');

	- check if i trade an item from equipped slot, will it remove it's effects from me ?
	- some way to be able to link items in chat. Query based on item guid ( or owner + itemguid )
	- after all kill targets have been cleared, clear hearthstone cooldown
	- RI_MELEE_CRIT_DMG_PCT should affect abbilities
	- RI_SINGLE_TARGET_TO_AOE_DMG does not work for melee abilities ?
	- Haste has no effect on DPS for most classes ? Maybe value is too large ? Maybe it overflows ?
	- make server wide unique stats / items -> could be rewarded to most "active" players. Maybe visual effects ? 
	- renew does not benefit from added aura duration. Maybe there are more ?
	- when you buy an item, it will say that you need the addon even if you have the addon ?
	- make so craftable and stackable items stack to 100 instead 20 : update item_template set stackable = 99 where inventorytype=0 and stackable >= 20 and stackable < 100
	- bloodlust on damage taken does not recast due to sated ?
	- spell duration should not mod channel time ? or at least tick should happen anyway ? right now arcane missiles just freezes
